📊 What we achieved:
• Built a robust ML model with 80% prediction accuracy
• Analyzed key factors driving customer churn
• Implemented advanced feature importance techniques
• Developed a practical, business-focused solution

🔍 Key Insights:
1. Contract type is the #1 predictor of churn
2. Longer customer tenure = Lower churn risk
3. Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn
4. Automated feature importance analysis revealed hidden patterns

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Logistic Regression
- Feature Engineering
- One-Hot Encoding
- Statistical Analysis

💡 Business Impact:
• Early identification of high-risk customers
• Data-driven retention strategies
• Optimized marketing spend
• Enhanced customer satisfaction

🔑 Key Learnings:
1. Month-to-month contracts show highest churn risk
2. Customer tenure is inversely related to churn
3. Feature importance analysis is crucial for model interpretability
4. Proper data preprocessing significantly impacts model performance
